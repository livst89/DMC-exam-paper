\textbf{\textit{Abstract:}} This paper investigates some of the implications of big data collection on Facebook and users’ privacy awareness. This is done by having conducted a focus group interview to explore some users’ privacy awareness on the social media platform, and relating the gathered information to a previous study within the subject area. In order to also get a better understanding of the implications of the gathered information, theories from Giddens and Maslow are used to gain both an interpersonal and a societal perspective. The conclusion is that the need for self-articulation through social media outweighs the concern for privacy, as long as users do not feel threatened.
